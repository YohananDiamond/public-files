# Code Files

Here are some code files that I want to upload, but they are too complex to be into only gist and too small to have their own repos.<br>
Quality is not assured in any way. This could be also called a "junk folder".

| File / Folder | Description |
| :-----------: | ----------- |
| yapl/         | "Yet Another Programming Language" >> A pseudocode language I made, along with some... files. |
| imagine-os-master.zip | Backup of the "imagine-os" repository (currently archived and private), that used to host some pseudocode I made on 2018 and 2019. |
