# DiamondCore

It's an improved version of ``DiamondPOW``, which is a fake system I made.

Although this doesn't work, I like coding these types of things, and I'm not quite sure why.

This code uses ``FakePython``, which is basically a bunch of python code that uses too much unexisting functions and probably will fail.
